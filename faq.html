                        <h3>What is Pactflow?</h3>
                        <hr class="question" />
                        <p>At its core, Pact is a managed version of the Open Source <a href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker">Pact Broker</a>, with added features for teams and enterprises looking to scale their contract testing.</p>
                        <p>Pactflow allows teams to increase their application quality and time-to-market by speeding up the release cycle for large-scale integrated systems. Whether you build microservices, messaging systems or cloud native (e.g. lambdas) systems, Developers and Testers can write simple, isolated unit tests for each integration in their application and generate API contracts that are guaranteed to be up-to-date with their code, ensuring all dependencies are always compatible.</p>
                        <p>This unit test approach is simpler, faster and more reliable than traditional end-to-end acceptance tests for a variety of use cases, and can be integrated easily into a holistic testing strategy.</p>

                        <h3>Who should use Pactflow and why?</h3>
                        <hr class="question" />
                        <p>Pactflow is designed for developers, QA teams and engineering managers who are building, testing and supporting distributed systems - such as web applications based on a microservices architecture. </p>
                        <p>Modern product engineering typically involves numerous, often distributed teams, requiring an effective collaborative workflow to evolve the design of their APIs.</p>
                        <p>Pactflow addresses this challenge, by enabling a seamless workflow to share contracts between teams, visualise their dependencies and integrate their CI, whilst reducing the administrative burden of managing extra servers for tooling.</p>

                            <p>The Team plans use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per-seat_license">"seat"</a> based model, where you purchase capacity for how many Users you need and assign them as required.</p>
                            <p>A user is considered any person or system that requires independent access to the system. For example, if you have two team members Sally and Billy that will be logging into the UI, as well as a separate dedicated CI user for automation, they will each consume one seat for a total of 3.</p>
                            <p>Each user gets a read-only and read-write API token that can be used for automation (e.g. for use in CI or local verification testing). Each user is able to rotate these tokens as needed.</p>

                        <p>For user (and system user) access, as it stands, there is just one mechanism: two principles - a read-only and read-write user authenticated via Basic Authentication. We are currently working on implementing social login via GitHub and other providers, as well as SAML authentication in the future. We expect to have this feature production ready early in 2019. If you would like to be involved in an early beta program, or have feedback for our roadmap we would love to hear it.</p>
