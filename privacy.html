          <h3>1. DiUS is committed to best-practice privacy standards</h3>
          <p>We are committed to protecting your personal information and letting you know the type of information we collect and how this information is used. Our Policy is based on the National Privacy Principles, developed by the Office of the Australian Federal Privacy Commissioner which came into effect 21 December 2001.</p>
          <p>DiUS also intends to comply with any guidelines or         laws introduced in Australia to strengthen protections for our privacy.</p>
          <h3>2. Collecting information about you</h3>
          <p>The amount of information we collect about you depends on our use of our website. The only personal information we         collect is what you tell us about yourself in your account         profile. The information you provide in your profile is         shared with site administrators and users with employer         accounts, employers must provide a registered Australian         Business Number (ABN) to obtain and employer account.</p>
          <p>We also use your personal information for research or to         improve our site and the services we offer you. We analyze         the data for certain trends and statistics, such as which         parts of our site users are visiting and how long they         spend there. This information is compiled and analyzed on         an aggregated basis. We may share this aggregated         information with our content providers to assist them in         understanding our services but we do not give our content         providers aggregated information that would allow them to         identify you personally.</p>
